the input is HTTP request
each url in urls.py fetches the corresponding function that is existing in views.py
HTTP request is generated through some application running on some browser
HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol -It uses TCP
1 url me 2 functions nhi work krenge but 2 urls me 1 function work krega
url generates request that goes to views.py
render calls HTML file
request.method == POST is false for the first time bcz data is not submitted
POST is a methd of request module
even if the condition is false, the html file is same but we can have different files if we provide different paths
HTML file displays the form in the browser
when the submit button is clicked, the data is redirected to same view because any other action is not mentioned
to send the data to the database we use CRUD operations
It will deploy the model and send the data to the database
model is a database model, used to define the structure(schema) of database
we need to define the database (done in models.py by making classes)
ORM -- Object Relational Model
we need to run migration, so that django server runs sql query on behalf of user (Example for abstraction)
Database storage ***
If want to retrieve data from database, we need to use ORM
